# NOT NECESSARY IF YOU DON'T NEED TO RUN A SERVER LOCALLY

cd /pick_a_folder
git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git

cd node
git checkout v0.4.12  #or latest stable version

./configure
make
make install #finish nodejs install

# curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh #install npm

After all that, you have to be specific when installing the 
modules:

1. npm install connect@0.5.10
2. npm install express@1.0.7
3. npm install socket.io
4. find . -name '.git' -prun-o -regex '.*\.\(c\|cpp\|h\|hccp\)$' -prune -o -print   | xargs grep "'sys'" -l   | xargs sed -i "s/\bsys\b/util/g"

The last line fixes incompatibility issues in node modules that haven't been
updated to the correct calls in node yet. Cool, eh?
