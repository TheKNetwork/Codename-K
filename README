=== IMPORTANT: RE-RUN STEP 1, WE UPGRADED TO DJANGO 1.4 ===

### Developer Instructions ###

1. After cloning, cd to Codename-K and run pip install -r requirements.txt
2. cd to ./codenamek
3. run ./manage.py syncdb (NOTE: if you're upgrading to django 1.4, run flush instead of syncdb)
4. run ./manage.py runserver

When running manage.py, you'll see some notes about what users you can test with. As usual, open http://localhost:8000 in a browser.
